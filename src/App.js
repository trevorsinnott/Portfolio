          Hi! I'm Trevor, a front-end developer who loves learning and building
          new things. Whether that's making PWA's with React, going to developer
          meetups, or writing command line games in Ruby. I love surrounding
          myself with people who are passionate and curious about what they do.
          If that means you, please get in touch!
        </p>
